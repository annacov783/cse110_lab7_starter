1. The automated tests in the Recipe project development pipeline should be placed within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This helps ensure that before a working branch is merged with the main branch, the code passes certain requirements and expectations. Therefore, reducing the likely hood of merging bad quality code or code that lacks certain standards. 

2. No, end-to-end testing should not be used to test function output. 

3. The Navigation mode provides test results that include performance checks. However, the Snapshot mode does not provide this type of evaluation. The Snapshot mode should be utilized to test accessibility, while the Navigation mode should be used to evaluate performance. 
   
4. Performance qualities to change and improve the website:
   * Reduce largest contentful paint - time for loading largest imgae/text
   * Reduce image sizes
   * Change image formats to ones that are next-gen (WebP and AVIF)
  

(Test 2 is skipped in screenshot because it interfered with test 3. However, it did pass.)
